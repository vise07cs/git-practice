Git & GitHub Class Notes
-------------------------
Git is a version control software.
GitHub is a platform used to store all developers' project source code in one place.
On GitHub, we can create repositories to store project code.
All developers can connect to the GitHub repository for code integration (making code integration very easy).
GitHub allows tracking of all code changes:
Who modified
When modified
What was modified
Why modified


# Environment Setup
Create an account at github.com (free of cost).
Download & install Git client software: https://git-scm.com/downloads
Open Git Bash and configure your name and email:
git config --global user.name "your-name"
git config --global user.email "your-email"


# What is a GitHub Repository?
----------------------------------
A repository is a place to store project source code/files.
For each project, one GitHub repository is created.
Two types of repositories:
Public Repo: Anybody can see & you choose who can commit.
Private Repo: You choose who can see & who can commit.
Example:
Project Git Repo URL: https://github.com/ashokitschool/sbi_loans_app.git

Project team members use the repo URL to connect.

# Git Architecture
-----------------------------------------
Working Tree
Staging Area
Local Repository
Central Repository (Remote)


# Git Bash Commands
---------------------
git init              # Initialize working tree
git status            # Show working tree status
git add <file-name>   # Add file to staging area
git add .             # Add all files to staging area
git commit -m "msg"   # Commit staged files to local repo
git push              # Push local commits to remote repo
git restore <file>    # Unstage or discard changes
git log               # Show commit history
git rm <file-name>    # Remove a file
git clone <repo-url>  # Download remote repo to local
git pull              # Get latest changes from remote repo
